MASTERMIND

A game in which the computer randomly picks four colors that the user has to guess.

On each turn, type in the names of four colors from the list of 8 colors at the top of the screen. If a color is in the correct spot, it will say so
but it won't tell you which color or which position is the correct one, simply that you got one correct. 
If a color is in the computer's list of four colors, then it will tell you a color is correct, but not the position.
If a color is incorrect, you get no feedback. 

If there are duplicate colors (example: red, blue, red, orange) and one is in the correct spot, you will not know if a duplicate color exists. 
This feature makes the game particularly hard, but still a fun guessing game.

User has 10 guesses to crack the code, if not, the computer wins.
